# 🌐 Bringing Graph Theory Learning to Life: Interactive Platform

Link: https://learngraphtheory.org/ 

Graph theory is a beautiful blend of logic, creativity, and real-world influence. This project aims to transform the way we **learn, visualize, and explore graph concepts**—moving beyond static textbooks and code into an engaging, hands-on experience.

## ✨ Inspiration

What sparked this project?

- 🔎 **Lack of Intuitive Experimentation:** Most resources only teach theory—they don’t let you build, tweak, or visualize graphs in real time.
- 🎬 **Opaque Algorithms:** Watching algorithms like BFS, Dijkstra’s, or network flow animate step-by-step turns confusion into “aha!” moments.

## 🚀 Platform Features

### 1. 🖱️ Interactive Graph Workspace

Build, edit, and play with graphs visually:

- **Double-click** to add nodes, drag them anywhere.
- **Shift-click** to connect nodes with edges.
- **Right-click** to edit edge weights and directions.

Say goodbye to messy paper diagrams and tedious code!

### 2. 🧮 Deep-Dive Into Algorithms

A growing library with **stepwise-animated** algorithms:

| Category                  | Algorithms                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Graph Traversal           | Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Topological Sort, Eulerian Path/Circuit                        |
| Shortest Paths            | Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall                                                                   |
| Minimum Spanning Trees    | Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Borůvka’s                                                                             |
| Connectivity & Components | Tarjan’s SCC, Cycle Detection                                                                            |
| Network Flow              | Ford-Fulkerson, Minimum Cut                                                                              |
| Special Challenges        | Hamiltonian Path, Graph Coloring                                                                         |

**Each algorithm includes:**
- Concise use-case explanations
- Complexity breakdowns
- Step-by-step animations (rewind/fast-forward at your pace)
- Smart prompts (e.g. start node selection)

### 3. 📚 Structured Learning Path

Not just a sandbox—this is a guided, progressive course!

- Lessons grouped by difficulty, with estimated durations and clear syllabi
- **Practice Mode:** Cement understanding right after learning
- **Progress tracking:** Always know your next step

---

### 4. 🧮 Immediate Graph Analysis

Stay informed as you build:

- **Real-time stats:** Node/edge count, density
- **Properties:** Check for connectivity, cycles, bipartiteness
- **Advanced metrics:** Components, diameter, avg. degree
- **Random graph generator & instant presets** (complete, cycle, tree, bipartite)

---

### 5. 🌈 Visual & Accessibility Touches

Designed for use, not just display:

- **Zoom/auto-fit** controls for big graphs
- **Import/export** your work or share with others
- **Overlay toggles** for visualizing node/edge details

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Graph theory powers social networks, logistics, compilers, bioinformatics, and beyond. This platform is built for:

- 🎓 *Students*: Visual, stepwise understanding
- 🧑‍🏫 *Teachers*: Demonstrate dynamically in class
- 🕵️ *Self-learners*: No more setup headaches—just experiment

---

## 🚧 What’s Next?

On the roadmap:

- Launching comprehensive PDF courses
- Expanding to advanced topics—spectral graph theory, dynamic algorithms
- Collab mode and new accessibility features

> If hands-on, visual graph theory excites you—or you want to help build the future of interactive learning—**reach out!** Feedback, feature requests, and collaborators are welcome.

Let's make learning graphs as interconnected and vibrant as the subject itself.
